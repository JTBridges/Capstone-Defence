Account creation:
Please click the "register" button located at the top of the webpage (or in the navigation bar on mobile).
You will be able to create an account on this page. After verifying your email (a link will be sent to the email address provided)

Installing the game:
The game could be found by clicking the "download" tab. If you're on a computer, the .apk file will download and you could install it on your Android
device using standard install procedures. If you're on mobile, you could download the .apk onto your device and install it on your Android phone.

Playing the game:
Upon opening the game, you need to log into the same account that you used to sign into the website. After doing so, you will be brought
to the landing screen where you could quit, change gameplay settings, or start a new game. The joystick-like controls help you guide your character while playing.
The log button chops down the tree that is in front of you, and the hammer button places a cannon at the previously-chopped tree location.
Once you determine that you placed the necessary amount of cannons, you could tap the start wave button to start the opponent wave.
Although the cannons will attempt to kill the enemies, you could kill them yourself by repeatedly tapping on them.

The longer you play the game, the difficulty of the game increases as more enemies are spawned, making it increasingly more difficult to kill all of them
before they reach your tower. Careful planning and strategy is required to be successful.
The game is over when one of the enemies reaches your tower and destroys it.
Once that occurs, your username and overall score will be placed on the leaderboard on the website.

Take a break reminder:
Occasionally, you will be reminded to take a break if you've been playing too long. If you prefer not to receive these messages,
tapping on the 'x' button on the notification will prevent it from showing up for the remainder of the game.
